# Rust CRUD Web Server Blueprint (WIP - Work in Progress)

ðŸš§ This blueprint is currently under active development. While it's designed to provide a foundational setup for creating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web servers using Rust, some features might be experimental or subject to change.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Rust and Cargo](https://rustup.rs/): Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed.

### Installation

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/rust_crud_server_template.git
````
### 2. Navigate into the directory:
```bash
 cd rust_crud_server_template
````

### 3. Run the server (usually via cargo run, but this can vary depending on your setup):
```bash 
cargo run
```

### Features
* CRUD Operations: Efficient Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality.
* Optimized Performance: Built with performance in mind to handle numerous requests.
* Maintainability: Structured for easy understanding and future updates.
